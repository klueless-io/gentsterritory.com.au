<p>For some men, a man cave is an escape route from their daily lives, a place they can go to get away from their families and loosen their belts. They can watch TV, listen to music, drink beer, build models or engage in any number of activities without having the kids or the wife around. A man cave could be a room in the basement, attic or garage, or a bomb shelter or storage shed.

By transforming an RV into a man cave, a <span style="color: #bf9000;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/respect-my-rules" title="Respect My Rules " style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>man can have his privacy</strong></a></span> and take it to the streets. Visiting friends, taking road trips or going to a tailgate party will be possible with your traveling man cave.<br><br></p> <h2><strong>Converting an RV into a Traveling Man Cave</strong></h2> <p>Provided you already own an RV, you can convert it into the man cave of your dreams. Each man will have his own idea of what the traveling man cave should include, but you'll probably want to consider some of the following items. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><br><br><br></span></p> <h3><strong>Media Systems</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/travel-mobile-man-cave-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">A traveling man cave should be equipped with a semi-large plasma screen or HDTV. As far as TVs are concerned, the bigger the better. To get the most variety while camping in your traveling cave, install a mobile satellite dish on the roof of the RV. Don’t forget the DVD/CD player.<br><br>Many entertainment systems can play DVDs and CDs and even have a USB connection to view the Internet on the big screen. Speaking of Internet, make sure you include a wireless Internet connection in the mix. Last but not least, install some <strong>high-quality speakers</strong> so the media center sounds as good as it looks.

With the Internet, you can download just about anything.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Beverages</strong></h3> <p>Consider installing a tap and keg setup in your traveling man cave. What better way to enjoy your entertainment choices than to sip on a frosty beer while you do? Along with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ntne2u" target="_blank" title="Beer Brewing keg Vintage Wood Oak Timber Wine Barrel " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>keg cooler</strong></span></a>, <strong>add a portable refrigerator to store some snacks</strong>.</p> <p>To entertain in style, add a <strong>liquor cabinet</strong>. Keep perishable mixers in one of the coolers and stock the cabinet with an assortment of clear and colored liquors.</p> <h3> <br> <strong>Other Additions</strong> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/travel-mobile-man-cave-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Other items to include in your traveling man cave might include the following: a portable grill for tailgate parties, a comfortable bed for those times you need to take a break or should not be driving, and an <strong>assortment of sporting gear</strong>.</p> <p>Be sure to keep plenty of charcoal and lighter fluid on hand, an extra set of sheets and a toolbox, in case something needs fixing.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>How to Hook Up an RV Power Outlet:<br><br></strong></h2> <h3><strong>Parts of an RV power outlet</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/travel-mobile-man-cave-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">To ensure the proper hooking up of your RV power outlet, make sure all required parts and accessories are already prepared. <br><br> Essential RV power outlet electrical parts include adapters for maximum power input and output, extension power cords, hatches, inverters, isolators, male/female plugs, receptacles/outlets, RV circuit breakers/fuses, RV converters, RV power outlets, RV surge protectors and switches.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Checking the Polarity</strong></h3> <p>You can use an open circuit tester, a polarity tester or a ground tester to check the polarity before you plug in your RV power outlet. Your electrical system and its components, such as other appliances, can sustain damages from reverse polarity. <br><br> Before plugging in the RV power outlet, make sure that you have turned off the campground post circuit breaker. Various safety hazards may occur if the post circuit breaker has been plugged into the RV power outlet while turned on.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Grounding</strong></h3> <p>The campground post electrical outlet must also be checked prior to plugging in your RV. For this function, an electrical tester would be the most appropriate instrument. This would also be beneficial to minimize errors in turning off electrical power and in identifying circuit breaker<br><br></p> <h2><strong>How to Install an RV Access Door Hatch <br></strong></h2> <p>RV hatch doors can be very different from each other, so it is important to find the right model and fit for your new door. Since RV doors are rarely made to a standard size, replacing them can unfortunately be very expensive. A new door can run between $400 and $500 depending on which features are included. In order to do the job properly, be sure to have the right tools and to follow the directions in the correct order.<br><br></p> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 1 - Remove the Old Door</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Remove all screws and/or bolts from the old door, and pull it out. Remove the frame as well. Clean all remaining caulk and putty tape from the area.<br><br> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 2 - Order a New Door</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Now that there is a hole where your old RV door was, measure it. These will be the dimensions for your new door. Remember that your new door will come with a frame, so do not keep the old one in there.<br><br> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Decide which kind of new door you want with regard to your own preference for color and texture, what type of lock it should have, etc. Do not leave the new wrapped door in direct sunlight as this may be damaging.<br><br> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 3 - Apply Putty To the Door Frame</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Now that you ordered your door and it has arrived, it is now time to install it. First, put at least one layer of putty tape around the door frame. In addition to providing insulation, the putty will prevent damage to the frame. A damaged door frame might give you problems with the proper fit of the door.<br><br> </div> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/travel-mobile-man-cave-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 4 - Install the New Door</strong></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Place the new door on the hole and secure it with nuts and bolts with your socket wrench. The nuts and bolts go in holes in the new door.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">You might need to make new holes in your RV if the new holes do not match up with the old ones. With a plastic scraper or screwdriver, scrape away any excess putty tape sticking out from the door.</p> <br> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Step 5 - Maintain Your New Door Properly</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">You have now finished installing your new RV hatch. In order to get the most mileage out of your new door, remember to take care of it properly: adjust the striker plate and bolt so that the door opens and closes as smoothly as possible.</div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Lubricate the key cylinder on your lock at least annually. Also lubricate the hinges on your door, and wash and clean the fiberglass skin periodically. If too much dust and dirt accumulates on the skin, and the door is exposed to sunlight and wind, this may physically and chemically damage the door.</div> <br> Remember that replacing just the skin of the door can be nearly as expensive as replacing the entire thing.<br><br><br><br> <h2><strong>Vacation Homes With Ultimate Man Caves You Need To Experience</strong></h2> <p style="float: left;">These top-notch rentals have sleek hangout spots and entertainment spaces that take the concept of <strong>‘man cave’</strong> to a whole new level (literally).
