<p> The man cave. Packed to the rafters with man gear, such as trophies, antlers, games, men magazines, beer cans (used and collectible), faded plaid <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ntfiye" target="_blank" title="MEI XU Furniture Recliners Fold Office Household Study Lunch Break Lazy Chair" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Lay-Z-Boy chairs</strong></span></a> with food crumbs tucked into every possible crevice and electronic paraphernalia, this is almost a no-go zone. <br><br> The trouble is, this is a potential vermin safe haven unless it's kept clean regularly. And while it's a place where the men go to be boys, allowing it to reflect a frat house filled with chips, spilled beverages and foot odor is encouraging trouble. <br><br> Although you may want to ignore the man cave or just use a blow torch because you know it’s a big (and potentially nasty) job, eventually it must be attacked. Lace up your bio-hazard suit and grab every bottle, can or gallon of sanitizer and attack.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Tips For Cleaning A Man Caves</strong></h2> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Get Permission</strong></h3> <p>Now this step is highly personal to the man in question. You'll know whether you already have permission to cross the threshold of the man cave and begin cleaning, or whether you need to seek it. If you need to seek it, be assertive and have a factual list of why the man cave needs cleaning. <span style="color: #0000ff;"></span></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Top of this list should be family/household health and sanitary well-being, ridding the place of vermin hotspots, having a pleasant place to invite man friends back to and the fact that you'll go on strike cleaning anything else if the man cave stays filthy. </p> <p>Some of you may be thinking, "There is no way I am responsible for cleaning this man's man cave.</p> <ul></ul> <p>He should do it himself, just as he is expected to do his share in the house." Good for you, you've got it all sorted and just need to pass on your secret formula to every other woman seeking shared shouldering of the household cleaning. <br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"></span></p> <h3><strong>Focus First on What You Know to be Junk </strong></h3> <p>Finding items that must be thrown away isn’t for the man cave cleaning novice; it requires the acumen and intelligence of an experienced man cave ninja because it isn't just what's obviously strewn about––it's also about unearthing the hidden junk. <br><br> And while there is probably some fine line you're never going to grasp between a collectible beer can and a beer can destined for recycling (do you really care about any such distinction anyway), there are plenty of items you'll know instantly as junk, such as an empty chip package or half drunk beer bottles.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Focus first on what is clearly garbage and shift it on out and have a tough love approach to so-called collectibles that need recycling, not displaying.</p> To avoid a fight about collectible beer cans, rinse all beer cans and return them to him. Another thing to watch for - if they're flattened, they're for recycling.<br><br>If they're whole and undented they're being collected for something. Would you want him to come into your scrapbooking area and throw out every loose piece of paper that wasn't neatly stacked by color in a drawer?<br><br>Also ask if he's saving the recyclables for something specific, like a cause, or if that's household recycling. Respect boundaries.<br><br>Be shrewd and savvy when hunting for junk. Half eaten bags of chips easily sidle their way into intricate crevices of sofas, chairs and behind every piece of furniture. Beer bottles roll under things and cans are crushed (in demonstrations of man strength) and tossed every which way.<br>Dig right in between couch cushions. Prepare yourself for what you may find between and underneath couch or chair cushions because it may get ugly.<br><br>Carefully peel back each cushion and remove the food, candy, newspaper or coin stash hidden beneath. Consider unzipping each cushion as well––sometimes even men run out of hiding places for their wrappers and cans and may end up stuffing them inside the cushion itself.Dont forget to visit at <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/" style="color: #0000ff;">gentsterritory.com.au</a></span> more more amazing products for man’s cave<br><br> Check underneath just about anything that can be moved, shoved aside or peeled aside. Every piece of furniture in the man cave is fair game for trash hide n' seek and possibilities for stuffing junk run deep.<br><br>Don’t just look underneath the perimeter of the <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/seating" title="furniture "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>furniture</strong></span></a>; be sure to look all the way to the back, especially if it butts up against a wall.<br> <ul></ul> <ul></ul> Look up. Junk may be hidden in odd places such as on top of high entertainment centers or even lamps. <br><br> If you think like one of the guys, consider what you’d do with your bag of cookies after they’ve been eaten, but you really don’t want to get up and have to throw it away in the trash can. <br><br> And if you're really unfortunate, there may even be something splattered on the ceiling from a manly competition to see who could throw highest (let's just hope for your man's sake that it hasn't involved your cooking).<br><br><br> <ul></ul> <h3><strong>Deodorize</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>There’s a pretty good chance that your man has been sitting on his man cave couch after rolling around in the yard with the dog and it only gets worse when socks worn for days in a row are found stuffed into the sofa edges.<br><br> To restore the odor-friendly equilibrium, your next line of defense is to <strong>deodorize and sanitize the place</strong>, as follows:</p> <strong>Couches and chairs</strong>. If you had the foresight to put slip covers on all the upholstered items, take them off and wash them using the “sanitary” setting on your washing machine.

Rent or hire a steam cleaning company to sanitize upholstery or you could drown everything in Febreze (or another fabric deodorizing spray).<br> <ul></ul> Bleach and/or disinfect surfaces. The best way to murder germs is to go hard core and use bleach. Obviously, <strong>make sure bleach won’t damage the surface</strong> or you'll never hear the end of how you ruined the<span style="background-color: #eeeeee; color: #bf9000;"> <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/products/1970-chevy-chevelle-ss-front-end-wall-shelf-with-working-lights" title="1970 CHEVY CHEVELLE SS FRONT END WALL SHELF WITH WORKING LIGHTS " style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>car trunk</strong></a></span> sale find of the century.<br><br>For those areas that are tiled or have a non porous surfaces, bleach is probably fine; however, the only way to tell is to test the compound on a small, inconspicuous area. If you can’t use bleach, look for a disinfecting type agent instead. Even a <strong>wash down with vinegar and water</strong> will restore the healthy atmosphere.<br> <ul></ul> Spray disinfectant in the air, between couch cushions, underneath furniture and inside trash cans to release odor and germs from the area.<br> <ul></ul> Choose scents he agrees to, he might prefer simple pine disinfectant to floral scents, "fresh bread" or other scents. His airspace is personal too and there are some scents you wouldn't want in your sewing room if he reciprocated and cleaned it. If he's allergic to scents just get it clean and air it out by opening the windows.<br> <ul></ul> <h3> <b><br></b><strong>Organize, Dust and Vacuum </strong> </h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Dig into your pile of “stuff” and begin to organize. Make smaller piles such as a pile for mail, magazines, clothing etc. If something simply needs to be put back on a shelf or returned to its original home in the man cave and continue to organize.</p> Transport all piles back to the intended area. For example, if you have finally located the cable bill (amongst other pieces of mail), bring it to your desk or wherever you pay bills so it’s ready to be paid. Take dirty clothing to the laundry room, etc.<br> <ul></ul> Re-examine the room for errant scraps or items left behind. If you have a big job to do, it’s easy to overlook items so go back and give the room a once (or twice over) to ensure you’ve found everything.<br>Using wood or another cleaner, remove dust from all surfaces. You may also need glass and other types of cleaners depending upon the furniture in the man cave.<br>If your man cave has carpet, sprinkle the area with baking soda and/or deodorizing carpet freshener. <br><br> Wait a few minutes to allow the solution to soak into the carpet and then vacuum.<br><br>If the man cave has tile or wood flooring, sweep, Swiffer (using a duster) and then wash the floor using the recommended floor cleaner.<br> <ul></ul> <h3><strong><br> Liberate yourself from Cleaning the Man Cave</strong></h3> <p>This step should really be the first step because you need to bring the man with you as you're cleaning. Because in reality, this needs to be a training session, in which you demonstrate what he will be doing from now on. His space, his responsibility.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>And the embarrassment may just be enough that you'll never have to set foot in there to clean again. And if you're really lucky, he might apologize by showing a special movie for the two of you in his man cave. Lucky you.</p> <h3> <br><strong>The Essential Dos and Don’ts of Maintaining Your Man Cave</strong> </h3> <p>Think your man cave is missing that extra something to make it truly awesome?

Lifestyle magazine editor Brandon Smith recently said that when it comes to man caves, <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jun/17/the-essentials-of-planning-the-perfect-man-cave/" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">"not just any jersey-strewn space with a massive television will do"</a>.</span> <br><br> We couldn't agree more, and those dreams of yours can become a reality if you follow these essential Dos and Don'ts for maintaining your man cave…<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>DO: Have a vision for your man cave</strong></h3> <p>A man cave should have a decor that suits the style of the man who created it — it’s the one place you can express yourself totally without having to worry about what someone else might think. Putting together a man cave allows you a totally blank canvas on which to get to work on, so don't pass up the opportunity.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Have a little creative flair, if you want to, and do the sort of things you couldn't normally do in a living room or <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs" title="Man cave Designs Bedroom "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>bedroom</strong></span></a>. If you've managed to fit in a <span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>pool table</strong> </span>and want it to be the premier attraction of the room, add in an awesome oak wood cue rack or even some unique designs for the balls. </p> <p><br> If things are a little more open-plan and there's wall space to fill, <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/wall-art" title="wall art "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>put up wall hangings</strong></span></a> that speak to your interests, such as vintage movie prints or famous photographs.</p> <p>Whether it's a color scheme to match your favorite team, your choice of material for furniture and surfaces or even which drinks you stock, each factor of your man cave will play a part in how satisfying it is to be in. Choose them wisely, and you'll never want to leave.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>DO: Keep the man cave's purpose in mind</strong></h3> <p>Guys create their own space within a home for multiple reasons, all of which need their own special design and layout.</p> <p>If your man cave's purpose is simply to offer you another room to stay in exclusively, a similar approach to designing any living space can be maintained: comfy furniture, ample lighting, and a welcoming atmosphere.

A <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/the-audiophiles-den" title="The Audiophile's Den "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>music-orientated room</strong></span></a> could do with a touch of soundproofing, floor space to use instruments and a strong audio setup.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>DON'T: Ignore the senses</strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-8.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The first impression of yourself and any potential visitors to your man cave is important — and that will be shaped by simple things like how the area looks, feels and smells.<br><br>There's <a href="https://amzn.to/2NAjThQ" target="_blank" title="Rustic Man Cave Sign" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>nothing wrong with a rustic decor</strong></span></a> and a hint of whiskey in the air if your man cave focuses heavily on a bar area where you and your friends can relax with your favorite refreshments. <br><br>However, leaving open bottles lying around and not putting the beer pong table away once in a while can lead to off-putting smells and sticky surfaces.<br><br>If sports are your thing and you want your living space to be the <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/lights-off-popcorns-in" title="Lights off Pop Corns In "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>ultimate viewing room for the big game</strong></span></a>, a strong sound system may be a smart purchase. <br><br>As might an extra television screen or two for wall-to-wall viewing — perfect for NFL action on Sundays, when you can watch your favorite team on one screen and keep an eye on the Redzone action on another. All while keeping your feet warm on a rug that represents your team, of course.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>DON'T: Forget the Essentials</strong></h3> <p>No room, regardless of its purpose, can do without some key features to make it a long-term living space, and your man cave is no different.</p> <p>Make sure there's plenty of access to power along the walls — preferably in areas that are easy to reach and don't require extension cords to be strewn scruffily (and dangerously) across the floor. For tech-heavy man caves, using a dedicated circuit or having a small generator are not bad ideas, either.</p> <p>Fit in a radiator or at least bring in a heater of some sort for the winter, but also make sure there's a chance for fresh, cool air to get in when it's hot out.<br><br> If you plan on using online features or watching TV, make sure a WiFi system and satellite provider are easy to connect to.</p> <p>Oh, and lock it up when you leave!<br><br></p> <h3><strong>DO: Plan ahead</strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-house-keeping-9.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Without a little organization and pre-planning, what you imagined as the ultimate destination of masculine interests can easily turn into an overstocked spare room. <br><br>Impressive man caves do not necessarily require acres of room and pockets full of expendable income. All it takes is some preparation and dedication to not just get the job done, but to do it in style.<br><br>Go into the design process of your man cave with a clear idea in mind of what you want to achieve. Is the room just for you or also for your friends? Do you want a place for quiet relaxation, or a room full of noise and activities? If every idea for your man cave looks to achieve a certain goal, your own little Feng Shui masterpiece will be complete.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>DON'T: Let your Man Cave go to Waste</strong></h3> <p>It might not be sexy, but a little maintenance from time to time, preferably once or twice a month, should ensure that your man cave stays as welcoming and enjoyable as when you first walked in.</p> <p>Dust down those counters and fixtures on the wall so cobwebs don't form. Get a vacuum cleaner on the floor and under the furniture to ensure crumbs don’t attract animals like mice. <br><br> Make sure any wood is treated, get some coasters to avoid rings on table tops from beer or coffee, and take out any dirty dishes or clothes to keep the room smelling fresh. If you've got a dartboard, pick up a dartboard cabinet to help limit the board's wear-and-tear and the stop the darts from rusting.</p> <p>All minor things, but overlooking a handful of these instructions can make your space a far less enjoyable place to be. Stay on top of it, though, and you'll be able to reap the full potential of your man cave.</p> <p>For more man cave ideas on how to add fantastic finishing touches to your cave, visit <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/" style="color: #0000ff;">gentsterritory.com.au</a> </span>to inspire you and help you create the perfect space just for you.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>
