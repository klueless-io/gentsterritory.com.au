It is a place to which he retires after a long and hard day at work. It could be minimalist or even rustic, and should underline the man's personal idea of style. If you are a bachelor looking for inspiration to design your bedroom, try to recollect the best hotel room you've lived in. Men often look for features inspired by <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/turning-your-garage-toa-car-lover-man-cave" title="CAR LOVER - GARAGE MAN CAVE "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>automotive design</strong></span></a>, but in spite of all, it should be cozy and comfortable. Read on for some effective advice on a single man's bedroom.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-15.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><strong>Comfort is a Must in a Man's Bedroom</strong> </h2> Quality, comfortable furniture has to be bought keeping both form and function in mind. If you are going for a bedside chair, get a lounge chair or one built with a cup holder in the handle. <br><br>Bean bags could seem comfortable from a distance, but they haven't really been designed keeping the human form in mind. Stay away of them and get a <a href="https://amzn.to/2NBkIaw" target="_blank" title="Mies Van Der Rohe Replica Barcelona Chair Premium Leather - White" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Barcelona Chair</strong></span></a> as it affords the utmost comfort.

The must-haves of a young man's bedroom are a basic bed in grays and other solid colors. Angular lines offer more masculinity.<br><br>A little <strong>leather chair</strong> looks great in the bedroom. Have a tidy dressing area and cupboard component alongside. You could alternately have a black-and-white themed bedroom and a lounge chair beside the bed. <p> </p> <br><br> <h2></h2> <h2> <br><strong>Neutral colors are a good choice</strong> </h2> Neutral colors are a man's best friend. They are a safe choice and are versatile. They also let a man host others in his bedroom and accommodate their style. White, black and gray are great choices.<br><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-17.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"><br> <div style="text-align: left;">If you want to add additional colors, it is better to do so by way of artwork or wall decor instead of getting gaudy colored bedding. Some feel that gray and black get too cold for a bedroom, so it can be suitably evened out by using natural fabrics like wool and linen.<br><br><br> </div> <img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-18.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"> <h2><strong>Some tips on wall decor</strong></h2> A single man's bedroom interior design is incomplete without a <strong>great wall decor theme</strong>, and this can be done by a personal touch. The wall in your bedroom is a space where you can flaunt both, your personal style, and your accomplishments.<br><br>Paper ephemera, including vintage maps, photographs and other collections adorn your walls beautifully. Other ideas for interesting wall decor are framed news clips, historical pictures, posters and even paintings. <p> </p> <br> <h2><strong>Try Adventurous and Unconventional Interior Designs</strong></h2> <div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-19.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></div> Attic style bedrooms are preferred by many single men these days, simply because of the combination of unconventionality and comfort that they offer. You can create a wooden base for the slanted ceiling area, with either single beds or workstations under the slant, for a unique sleep-work combination. You can also use wood for headboards and have retractable beds. <a href="https://amzn.to/2NtRNVx" target="_blank" title="Tartan Check Red, Double Complete Set" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Tartan</strong></span></a> for bedding is also a recent trend. <h2><strong><br><br> How to Design a Bedroom in a Small Space</strong></h2> <img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-20.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Whether you're living in an apartment, an older home or a compact new home, you can create a relaxing and beautiful bedroom in a small space. <br><br>Small bedrooms can be functional and comfortable for children, teens or adults and can even offer enough space for a couple to share.<br><br>Smart planning, ample storage and thoughtful styling are all critical to small-space bedroom design.

You may want to choose a very light shade to brighten the room and create the appearance of a larger space.<br><br>Shades of white, pale blue, light gray or pale yellow can all create a light and bright small room. While light colors will make your space appear brighter and larger, you can also opt for a dark shade or a jewel tone.<br><br><strong>Dark, rich colors</strong> will create a<strong> warm and cozy feeling in a small bedroom</strong>. Go for an opulent look with jewel tones or opt for a more modern feel with an elegant gray tone.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-22.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <h2><strong>Smart Storage</strong></h2> Adequate storage is essential in a small bedroom, particularly if your small bedroom is accompanied by inadequate closet space. Choose pieces for your room that incorporate storage, including small chests in place of nightstands and beds with drawers underneath.<br><br>One of the most effective ways to add storage in a small bedroom is to <strong>create a wall of built-ins surrounding your bed</strong>. A wall of built-in cabinetry can provide ample space for storage while taking up next to no floor space. Well-designed built-ins can even incorporate nightstands and lighting.<br><br><br> <h2><strong>Downsize</strong></h2> The largest item in most bedrooms is, of course, the bed. While a king-size bed may be indulgent, if you're living in a small space, it may also take up the entire room. Depending upon your needs it may be worth it to go big, but downsizing to a queen, full or, if you're sleeping alone, even a twin bed will free up floor space for other furnishings.<br><br><br> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-23.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <h2><strong>Lighting and Decor</strong></h2> Lighting can affect how your room looks and feels. Choose warm, soft lighting for your room rather than harsh or bright lights.<br><br>Whether you've opted for light or dark shades on the walls and in the furnishings, the right lighting will help your small room feel cozy rather than confining.<br><br><strong>Hang mirrors to create the illusion of a larger space</strong> and <strong>incorporate a piece or two of artwork you love</strong> into your small bedroom to create a <strong>small space that feels like you belong there</strong>.<br><br><br> <h2> <br><strong>Overall Layout</strong> </h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-bedroom-designs-24.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Choose a layout for the room that <strong>maximizes walking space</strong> as well as keeps any windows unblocked. Place the bed -- the largest furniture piece -- in the center of one wall in the room to create a focal point. Avoid placing the bed in a corner, which would emphasize the small size of the bedroom.<br><br>Put the dresser -- the second largest furniture piece -- on the opposite wall to the bed to bring balance to the space. Avoid placing all of the furniture on one side of the room or overcrowding the room.

Darker colors make the room appear smaller and uninviting.<br><br><br> <h2><strong>Reminder !!!</strong></h2> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Avoid a round or oval-shaped bed.<br><br> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Bed should always have a head rest.
