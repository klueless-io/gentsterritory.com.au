Measure the length from the wall that you want the man cave bar to extend.<br><br>A common length is 7 feet. Cut your 2 of your 2x4 boards to this length (7 feet or another measurement), using best safety practices with your miter saw.<br><br>These boards will be the top and bottom plates. <br><br>Mark with a pencil on each plate where you want the "studs" to go; make them identical markings on each of the 2x4s. Square the lines.<br><br><br> <h2><strong>Step 2: Cut For The Studs</strong></h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-5.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> How tall do you want the bar? ​The standard home bar height is 42" or 3.5 feet. Work out where to cut the studs by using this equation: 42" - 3" (top and bottom plates) - 3/4" (<a href="https://amzn.to/2NxzCOK" target="_blank" title="MDF Boards " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>MDF board</strong></span></a> is that thick) = 38 1/4". This amount is where you will cut for the studs.<br><br>Cut as much as you need to accommodate all of the markings on both top and bottom plates. Then screw the studs into between the 2 plates. Line up the studs with the lines you made on each plate.<br><br><br> <h2><strong>Step 3: Time To Stand Up</strong></h2> Stand up your frame. Ensure it is level with the wall or at 90 degrees. Attach it to the wall using the end stud and be sure to use your lever to make sure your frame is just right.<br><br>If your bar does not run the length of the room, now is the time to secure it to the floor. Use nails to attach the bottom plate to the floor (obviously it depends on what the floor material is). Google online for help if needed with this part.<br><br><br> <h2><strong>Step 4: Add Shelves</strong></h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-6.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> Add a shelf to your man cave bar frame next. For the project shown here, we are building 3 shelves. The height of the shelf we designed here is 20". Use 6 x 2x4s that are each 10"; they will be 3 pairs of top and bottom plates for the shelf structure.<br><br>Figure out where to put the studs. Use the same equation as before: ​20" - 3" (for top and bottom plates) = 17".<br><br>This amount is where you cut for the studs. You will cut 6 plates if you have 3 structures as we do here. Screw the top and bottom plates for the 3 structures using the same method as before.​<br><br><br> <h2><strong>Step 5: Stabilize The Bar</strong></h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> For the top plate of the main framework, add stabilizers to reinforce it. Cut several 2x4s to lay across the top so that you have one covering each stud. Cut the boards the width that you want for the bar top.<br><br>Cut the amount (such as 8") that hangs over the front and the amount that hangs over the back of the bar top (such as 10") and add the amount for the top plate (such as 3") to figure out how long each 2x4 should be. Screw the stabilizers to the top ​plate. Use 4 screws. They will be underneath the bar top. The MDF board goes on top.<br><br><br> <h2><strong>Step 6: Put On The Man Cave Bar Top</strong></h2> <img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-8.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">It's time to cut the MDF board to form the bar top. How wide should it be? Use your table saw to cut its length to the size of the top and bottom plates and the stabilizers size for width.<br><br>Attach the MDF bar top by screwing up from underneath the stabilizers.​<br><br>Take the 1-1/2" trim and cut it to the length of the MDF board on the bar. Attach the trim to the board with finish nails, making it plumb with the top of it using your level.<br><br><br> <h2> <br><strong>Step 7: Finishing Touches</strong> </h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-9.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> Add material to the front face of the bar that suits the theme of your man cave. That will cover up the frame. You could go with a <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/welcome-to-the-yesteryears" title="Welcome to the Yesteryears "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>retro 60's pattern</strong></span></a> to match your <em>Mad Men </em>home office, support the Mets like in the bar shown above or use any other style you want. Here is a <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/stry/adding-a-padded-bar-front-to-your-bar#b">how-to guide </a>for adding a padded bar front to your man cave bar.<br><br>Don't worry if you still have things you want to tweak about the bar. Take your time with the finishing touches. The main thing is that you have built a stable bar. The visual stuff is secondary. <br><br>Now you have a bar to call all your own! Add bar stools and fill the shelves with a collection of your favorite bottles as well as glasses. Invite your buds over and show them what you crafted.<br><br><br>Your DIY self is pretty dope, you.

Putting together a man cave allows you a totally blank canvas on which to get to work on, so don't pass up the opportunity. <br> <br>Whether it's a color scheme to match your favorite team, your choice of material for furniture and surfaces or even which drinks you stock, each factor of your man cave will play a part in how satisfying it is to be in. Choose them wisely, and you'll never want to leave. <br> <br> <br> <h2><strong>DO: Keep the man cave's purpose in mind</strong></h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-11.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> Guys create their own space within a home for multiple reasons, all of which need their own special design and layout. <br> <br>If your man cave's purpose is simply to offer you another room to stay in exclusively, a similar approach to designing any living space can be maintained: comfy furniture, ample lighting, and a welcoming atmosphere.<br><br> <br> <h2><strong>DO: Plan ahead</strong></h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-12.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> Without a little organization and pre-planning, what you imagined as the ultimate destination of masculine interests can easily turn into an overstocked spare room. <br> <br>Impressive man caves do not necessarily require acres of room and pockets full of expendable income. All it takes is some preparation and dedication to not just get the job done, but to do it in style. <br> <br>Go into the design process of your man cave with a clear idea in mind of what you want to achieve. Is the room just for you or also for your friends? Do you want a place for quiet relaxation, or a room full of noise and activities? <br> <br>If every idea for your man cave looks to achieve a certain goal, your own little Feng Shui masterpiece will be complete.

Get a vacuum cleaner on the floor and under the furniture to ensure crumbs don’t attract animals like mice. <br> <br>Make sure any wood is treated, get some coasters to avoid rings on table tops from beer or coffee, and take out any dirty dishes or clothes to keep the room smelling fresh. If you've got a dartboard, pick up a <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/bar-gameroom/products/ultimate-dartboard-cabinet" title="ULTIMATE DARTBOARD CABINET "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>dartboard cabinet</strong></span></a> to help limit the board's wear-and-tear and the stop the darts from rusting. <br> <br>All minor things but overlooking a handful of these instructions can make your space a far less enjoyable place to be. Stay on top of it, though, and you'll be able to reap the full potential of your man cave.<br><br> <br> <h2><strong>DON'T: Forget The Essentials</strong></h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/big-bar-for-big-boys-14.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> No room, regardless of its purpose, can do without some key features to make it a long-term living space, and your man cave bar is no different. <br> <br>Make sure there's plenty of access to power along the walls — preferably in areas that are easy to reach and don't require extension cords to be strewn scruffily (and dangerously) across the floor. For tech-heavy man caves, using a dedicated circuit or having a <strong>s</strong><strong>mall generator</strong> are not bad ideas, either. <br> <br>Fit in a radiator or at least bring in a heater of some sort for the winter, but also make sure there's a chance for fresh, cool air to get in when it's hot out. If you plan on using online features or watching TV, make sure a WiFi system and satellite provider are easy to connect to. <br> <br>It’s important to make sure that all essential needed in your man’s cave bar should always ready regardless of how new or old is your man’s cave.<br><br> <p>See also: <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/men-go-pub" title="Men Go Pub "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Men Go Pub</strong></span></a>... </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
