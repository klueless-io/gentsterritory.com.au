And a DIY home bar doesn't have to be as dark and dusty as your favorite dive.</p> <p>The right lighting helps set a mood that makes drinking at your home bar different from just standing around the kitchen counter having a few beers.</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2NtpBlK" target="_blank" title="Battery Operated 300 LED Curtain String lights w/ Remote &amp; Timer" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>LED-strip kits</strong></span></a> are an easy and affordable way to give a bar a sleek glow. Flexible light strips come in several colors and can be chopped into lengths as short as 2 inches or kept in strips tens of feet long, provided you have an adequate power supply.</p> <p>Many of the flexible strips come with an adhesive back, making it easy to curve and then stick the strips exactly where you need them.</p> <p>Fitting the lights underneath the bar's cabinets or bar top gives the area a simple, sophisticated ambiance.

What we love about this pub-shed design is the indoor/outdoor nature of it. It includes, a pool table, jukebox, cinema system and bar at a cost of roughly $22,000 (converted from British Pounds).<br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/men-go-pub-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"><br><br>While we realize this design is probably a bit much for some – it is great for those “go big or go home” types out there.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Rustic is Just Right</strong></h3> <p>This design brings nature a bit more into it but offers a distinct charm. Functionally, it also closes up in bad weather, protecting bar stools and bottles. Its truly a manly design.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Pub Shed</strong></h3> <p>This highly personalized pub-shed is a perfect addition to a smaller yard. Little touches like the hanging dart board and the sign make it an inviting place to hang out. </p> <p>And it allows you to contribute your ideas about art and satisfaction after customizing you own pubman cave.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Open for Business</strong></h3> <p>This design looks like it could be out on the streets of Portland, not tucked away in a backyard.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/men-go-pub-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Is this the next big thing after food carts (we doubt it)? However, we love this simplistic design that is focused on function. </p> <p>It attracts people especially when its open and you can just stay for awhile and enjoy drinks with friends.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>More Fun with Multi-Purpose</strong></h3> <p>This is a well designed space that can be used as a pub shed or place to pot plants or other yard crafts. The slanted roof will drain nicely so that even during rainy Portland winters this space could be a nice respite.</p> <p>The movable table offers a slew of options when using this space. This is a great compromise between pub shed and outdoor kitchen.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>This Is How To Make Your Pub</strong></h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/men-go-pub-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div> <ul> <li>Shed Into Your Own Private Bar<br><br> </li> <li>This is a pub shed.<br><br> </li> <li>The concept is as simple as it is awesome...<br><br> </li> <li>It's a backyard shed that was turned into a pub.<br><br> </li> <li>Pub sheds can be large and elaborate or small and simple.<br><br> </li> <li>As long as you have room for a couple stools and a rack of booze.<br><br> </li> <li>They can be classy and neutral Or totally authentic.<br><br> </li> <li>Obviously this is a dream DIY project.
