<p>If you are starting from the beginning and still figuring out what to put in your man cave, the first decision you should make is which part of your space is going to be the focal point. If the bar is going to be the main hang out area then choose your <span style="color: #bf9000;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/big-bar-for-big-boys" title="Big Bar for Big Boys " style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>man cave bar</strong></a></span> first. <br><br> This will make choosing the rest of your man cave<span style="color: #bf9000;"> <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/seating" title="furniture " style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>furniture</strong></a></span> easier because you will have decided on the style of your center piece. For more amazing product for man cave furniture you can visit some online stores like: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/" style="color: #0000ff;">gentsterritory.com.au</a> </span><br><br> Similarly, if you are planning on having your TV and seating as the focal point, then perhaps choose your <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/seating/products/black-leather-rocker-recliner" title="BLACK LEATHER ROCKER RECLINER "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>man cave couch or chairs</strong></span></a> first. You need your furniture to match thematically with your center piece. If it does not then you will lose all continuity and your life will be over.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Comfortable Seating Makes Men Happy</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-furniture-1-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"><br>When choosing your seating you must ensure the first criteria you challenge yourself with is that of comfort. It is essential to you and your friends’ happiness and their willingness to return. Whilst looks are incredibly important, comfort is even more important. </p> <p>Comfort can be assessed by sitting on said seating prior to buying. If the shop in question has no objections, try having a snooze in said seating too. Sleep-ability is another essential quality to consider.</p> <p>However, if you do not have the option of trying any seating out before purchase (an online purchase for example) or you can visit here: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/" style="color: #0000ff;">gentsterritory.com.au</a></span>. Then read reviews and concentrate of the comfort factor first and foremost. <br><br> A <strong>chair’s ability to recline is very important</strong>. Almost as important is how close to the horizontal the reclamation goes. This determines its sleep-ability. So let us discuss man cave chairs.<br><br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Man cave chairs. To recline or not recline?</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><u><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-furniture-1-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"><br></u><strong>Man cave bar stools are no substitute for man cave chairs,</strong> let us be clear about that. So you want your friends to come around and watch the big game. Sure, they say. Yet when they get there they find that there is nowhere comfortable to sit down. There are no man cave chairs in sight. Oh dear. What you have done there is make the classic man cave error. <br><br> You have created a man cave that is devoid of comfy seating or is still in the construction phase prior to the delivery of said seating. You may as well go to the pub and watch the game on their big screen because your big screen has been rendered useless by every man on the planet.<br><br></p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-furniture-1-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p> <h2><strong>Comfy Man Cave Furniture</strong></h2> So before you send out invites and start wanting to show off your new creation, ensure the seating has been dealt with. Seating is a crucial part of your man cave furniture<span style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"> choices. <br></span></span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> </span> <p>You want comfy man cave chairs that will satisfy all your visitors for the entirety of a five day test match (that is the English sport of cricket and yes, it goes on for five days).</p> <p>The seating has to be in the line-of-sight of your fabulous full HD TV with nothing obscuring the view. Furthermore, you have to decide on whether you want all of your seats to recline, or only the man throne upon which you sit. Your budget or inclination may not want for reclamation (there is that word again), in which case perhaps puffs or ottomans are in order.</p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>The Man Cave Couch</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-furniture-1-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"><br>Much like your man cave chairs, your sofa(s) need to be comfortable otherwise you will not find your guests staying for the duration of the big game and will instead opt for going to the pub. </p> <p><strong>A man cave couch (or sofa) is also important for the wife or girlfriend</strong>. When she comes and visits you in your man cave to watch space ships shooting torpedoes at other space ships, she will want to sit next to you without a built-into-the-armrest beer cooler or games console separating you.</p> <p>Furthermore, this is the ideal time to cuddle up and make her feel special in your man space. This is vitally important. If your wife feels happy and comfortable in your man cave, your man cave will remain a friendly part of the household. If she sees it as a stinky, beer stained mess then your ability to utilize it properly will be deeply diminished. This is why choosing the perfect couch (or sofa) is of the utmost importance.

Yes, it is. <a href="https://amzn.to/2NBkIaw" target="_blank" title="Mies Van Der Rohe Replica Barcelona Chair Premium Leather - White " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>You can sit on it</strong></span></a>, sleep on it and eat and drink beer from it. That makes it furniture. The bar within your man space should be one of the most important, and possibly most expensive pieces of furniture you buy. The man cave bar counter top is the best place for vertical beer drinking with your buddies.</p> <p>OK, so not all man caves have or require a bar. It is perfectly acceptable to recline back in front of the TV and drink beer horizontally. When your buddies pay you a visit they can do the same. But for that extra pub-like experience without the pub-like regulations and drunken bar flies, a man cave bar is definitely worth considering.<br><br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>It’s a Man Cave Bar Counter, Size is Not Important.</strong></h2> <p>The bar does not have to be a big sprawling counter top able to fit hundreds of people calling your name frantically trying to get served. No, that is what pubs are for. Your bar can be small and compact, especially if space is a problem you have to deal with. <br><br> It isn’t the size that matters but how it looks and compliments the aesthetics of your man cave in general. On this occasion the saying “size does not matter” actually rings true.</p> <p> <br><br></p> <h3><strong>How to Shop for Man Cave Decor When Designing Your Manly Space</strong></h3> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-furniture-1-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> Every man wants some lone time with buddies pursuing favorite hobbies and pastimes.
