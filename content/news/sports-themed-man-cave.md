Whether you are desirous of your own personal sports bar or a gym, or perhaps a way to showcase your memorabilia. <span style="color: #0000ff;"></span></p> <h2> <br><strong>Here are Some Ideas on How to Spruce Up your Man Cave with a Sporty Theme</strong> </h2> <h3> <br><strong>Hanging Basketball LED</strong> </h3> <p>What better way to lighten up your <strong>sporty man cave</strong> than with a basketball shrouded with sparkling LED lights? It is pretty easy to put this together—you just need a string of LED lights, a ball and a way to hang your ‘ball of light’, and you’d be good to go. <br><br> If one piece does not adequately light up your den, you could add a couple more, may be two or three for that added light and extra sporty feel.<br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Ball Holder/ Display</strong> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/sports-themed-man-cave-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">This ball holder is a handy way of displaying your balls, whether you are into soccer, basketball or football.This is also another easy project that you can finish in a couple of hours.<br><br>Simply pick up a nice piece of wood, something that will look stylish in your cave; then, buy some triple-tonged handles and fix them onto the board.<br><br>Your balls should fit snuggly in the handles - making you the REAL court master , if you catch my drift! .

Hanging out at the sports bar in your favorite venue is cool, but <span style="color: #bf9000;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/big-bar-for-big-boys" title="Big Bar for Big Boys " style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>having your own bar</strong></a></span> where you can hang out with your boys is something that is utterly exciting.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>So, go all out and pimp your own sports bar with your favorite team’s memorabilia from the bar stools and table down to the flooring. While you are at it, take a look at our write-up on bar ideas!<br><br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Indoor Putting Green</strong> </h3> <p>There was a time, maybe a decade ago, when the idea of <strong>playing golf inside your house</strong> would sound outrageously crazy. Just thinking about the cost of building a golf course inside the house was enough to put off the regular Joe.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/sports-themed-man-cave-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"><br> But, all that’s changed thanks to affordable, easy to assemble putting turfs. Whether you have plenty of space in your basement or you are working with a small space, you can now enjoy a game of golf with friends on those wintry days. Lay down a putting green in your den and you just might not get any work done!</p> <h3> <br><strong>Perfect Entertainment Center <br></strong> </h3> <p>What’s a sporty man cave without the complete entertainment center? It is not enough to just have a sports bar and a couple of framed memorabilia of your favorite sports team. <br><br> How will you watch your favorite games? A real man cave needs plush, <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/theater-seating" title="theater seating "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>comfortable seats</strong></span></a> plus a good home theater. What’s better than watching your favorite game while chilling out in your <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/recliners/products/black-leather-pillowtop-2-seat-home-theater-recliner-with-cup-holders" title="BLACK LEATHER PILLOWTOP 2-SEAT HOME THEATER RECLINER WITH CUP HOLDERS "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>cushy recliner</strong></span></a>? Another idea is to have your recliners emblazoned with your favorite team's logo.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Sports-Themed Furniture </strong></h3> <p style="float: left;">If recliners are not your thing, why not have some of these unique and comfortable football themed benches. These are especially cool if you are looking to bring that casual, relaxed and whimsical atmosphere to your den. <br><br>Add a complementing table and you create a cozy hangout joint for you and the boys.

But don’t let that overwhelm the room.<br><br> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Balance is key in a man cave, as it should be a room of many activities. Throw in a bar, a cinema, a sound system – you want options.<br><br> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Show your Love for Sports</strong></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your love for sports is often kept under check by your significant other, who’d rather buy nice curtains and throw cushions than team-branded wallpaper. <strong><br></strong></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your man cave, however, gives you the option to show just how deeply you care for your favoured team – whilst creating an atmosphere and area where you can enjoy them winning.<br><br></p> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Don't be Afraid Not To Go With a 'Theme' </strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <img alt="" src="/img/news/sports-themed-man-cave-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Framed photos of sportsmen and glowing signs are all well and good, but if you’re an understated person, don’t push your man cave to be something you’re not.<br><br> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">If you just want to enjoy a few drinks, watch television and occasionally entertain, keep it simple, chilled and include just touches of yourself in the decoration and furniture.<br><br> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Don't be afraid to go gimmicky</strong></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">We’d never condone putting a full-size Pac-Man machine in your living room, or tucking a pinball machinn your dining room, but the man cave is a place where you can let your wildest dreams run wild.<strong><br></strong></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br> In fact, <a href="https://www.libertygames.co.uk/blog/the-future-of-retro-gaming/"><strong>75% of people</strong></a> want to do exactly that – so if you want to put a full-wall virtual reality golf simulator in your man cave, do it.<br><br><br></p> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Adjoin your garage for extra space/sophistication</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Man caves tend to be somewhere a little out of the way of your main house. Sometimes, this means converting the garage – but, if you’re lucky enough to have both, why not knock through and supersize your man cave, making your car a centerpiece of the whole space. Unless it’s an ageing Skoda, then probably best not…<br><br><strong><br></strong> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Go big or Go Home</strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <img alt="" src="/img/news/sports-themed-man-cave-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Clearly, at some point money will come into the construction of your man cave. But, if you have the funds to have some fun, then don’t hold back. Better install a full bowling alley into your basement than just move a sofa and flat screen television into your cellar. Have some ambition.<br><br> </div> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Don't be afraid to borrow your decor ideas Iconic bars and clubs around the world are iconic for good reason. So don’t be afraid to borrow ideas and designs from other establishments. Be that in colour scheme, furniture, or hanging a huge picture of Winston Churchill on the wall, you can’t go wrong if you follow in the footsteps of the professionals.

A man cave should be a multipurpose room.<br><br><br> </div> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Pick your style and stick to your style </strong></li> </ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">As it’s just one room, you don’t want your man cave looking too patchwork. If some of your furniture is made out of a light oak, don’t buy a mahogany desk to go in the corner. </div> <p> </p> <p>Your room should feel like a united space, so approach design with an eye to make a room that is identifiably you – and in which everything matches.

It's psychologically healthy for guys to have a place to proudly display things that they find important, valuable, or interesting.</div> <div></div> <div style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/sports-themed-man-cave-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></div> <p><br> Instead of keeping everything in a box that's pushed aside only to be found years later, having a place to decorate gives him the freedom to choose what goes up on the wall and what stays in the box. <span style="color: #0000ff;"></span></p> <p><strong>“Space is very important for regulating emotions,”</strong> says Sam Gosling, a University of Texas at Austin psychology professor and published author. Gosling believes that <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>space is a powerful mechanism</strong> </span>for evoking emotions, and he’s seen firsthand how having your own space, decorated by you alone, can positively affect emotional well-being.</p> <p><strong>Most displayed items: <br><br></strong></p> <ul> <li>Commercial neon signs</li> <li>Framed sports jerseys</li> <li>Baseball bats and balls</li> <li>Military memorabilia</li> <li>Model cars</li> <li>Vintage arcade games</li> <li>Pinball machines</li> <li>Game or fish mounts<br><br> </li> </ul> <h3><strong>3.

It's a place to hang out and be loud without anyone else caring or judging.</p> <h3>Top 8 most watched sports on TV:<strong> </strong><strong><br><br></strong> </h3> <ul> <li>Football</li> <li>Baseball</li> <li>Basketball</li> <li>Ice Hockey</li> <li>Soccer</li> <li>Tennis</li> <li>Golf</li> <li>Wrestling</li> </ul> <h3><strong>5.

Almost any space can accommodated a hobby or two. However, think about your man's specific hobbies and decide what's better - a backyard shed or garage, attic space, a dedicated portion of the basement, or a spare bed room. The point is, giving space to a man that he can use however he pleases is healthy and good for his mental and psychological well being. </p> <h3><strong><br>Practical Man Cave uses:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Workshop for cars, motorcycles, ATVs, snowmobiles</li> <li><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.dakotastorage.com/blog/ideas-for-creating-wood-workshop" style="color: #000000;">Woodworking shop</a></span></li> <li><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.dakotastorage.com/blog/create-your-own-home-gym" style="color: #000000;">Backyard gym</a></span></li> <li><span style="color: #000000;">Home theatre</span></li> <li><span style="color: #000000;">Music studio</span></li> <li><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.dakotastorage.com/blog/create-the-ultimate-game-room-in-your-backyard" style="color: #000000;">Game room</a></span></li> </ul> <h3><strong>Why hobbies are good <br></strong></h3> <ul> <li>They encourage taking a break</li> <li>They make people happy</li> <li>They provide an outlet for stress</li> <li>They break up routine<br><br> </li> </ul> <h2><strong>MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!</strong></h2> <p>As with all home additions, there can be many factors to take into consideration to either add the space or convert existing space. Fortunately, with a man cave it’s usually about converting space that already has heating, ventilation, and air conditioning as well as electrical service. At that point, it’s all about fitting all aspects of your dream into the existing space.</p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
