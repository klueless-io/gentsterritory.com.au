And that 60" flat screen TV?</p> <p>Well, it is capable of displaying family-friendly and cultural entertainment, as well as NFL and Fast and Furious 7, right?</p> <p>The spare corner that gets strong morning sunlight is a perfect spot to roll out a yoga mat. And the kids might love a section to set up an easel for watercolors or a table for crafts.</p> <p>The result is a fun, multi-purpose rec room that accommodates everyone in the family.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Finding a Space</strong></h3> <p>It is important that you carve out a dedicated place for your new play-zone. If you try to place it in rooms where other things are happening, you will never feel like you have totally escaped.</p> <p>All of those distractions that you are trying to avoid will be hanging around and driving you mad. So, from best to worst, here are five places to locate your future fun room <br><br></p> <h3><strong>Basement</strong></h3> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-layout-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/the-classy-old-timer-s-retreat" title="The Classy Old Timer's Retreat "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Classic man caves</strong></span></a>, just like real caverns, are located underground.<br><br>Deep within the earth, the basement provides a temperature - moderate, sound-insulated space.<br><br>If you are lucky enough to have a full basement, that space will be the same square footage as the floor above. <p>One problem with locating your mancave in a basement is that the basement must be finished before you can even begin installing the mancave.<br><br>Finishing a basement is laborious. It entails building out wall framing with wood or steel studs; insulating, wiring, and covering with drywall; laying sub-floor and finish floor covering; installing drywall on the ceiling; and wiring lights and receptacles.

Raucous mancave noise percolating to the rest of the house, or vice-versa, can be a problem.</p> <p>But this is remedied with simple sound-proofing techniques, such as installing a second layer of drywall on shared walls.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Garage</strong></h3> While a garage may seem like the perfect place for the mancave, think of this: where does the car go?<br> <ul></ul> <p>Consider also that garage conversions usually bring down the value of your property when you decide to sell.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-layout-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Home buyers tend to look down on conversions, mentally calculating how much less money to offer in the transaction to cover mancave-demolition costs.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is a growing trend towards using garage space for storage – and not for storing the car. If you’re not going to use it for vehicle storage, the space might as well become a leisure area. That aside, garages are great spaces for your mancave. <br><br> Many garages are already minimally finished with basic drywall, receptacles, and one or two lights, though finish flooring is always lacking. One other advantage that other spaces cannot touch: the big garage door. When weather is favorable, you can swing it up and open your mancave to the world.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Walk-In Closet</strong></h3> Walk-in closets represent the finest in the art of making do.<br> <ul></ul> <p>Turning a walk-in closet into a mancave demonstrates true creativity and builder’s spirit.</p> <p>The closet’s main downside is obvious: it is small, often no more than 16 square feet. But tiny can work to your advantage. <br><br> For one, you have less surface area to finish, so your project cost will be greatly reduced.</p> <p>This means you can upgrade the quality of your materials by using real hardwood veneer panels, architectural stone, solid hardwood flooring, or textured wall panels.

All essential services – electrical, plumbing, heating/cooling – are in place, freeing your inner designer to create the fantastic mancave of your dreams.</p> <p><strong>Second-best:</strong> you have a large basement (not a crawlspace) with a poured concrete floor.</p> <p>Begin your layout by prioritizing key areas that define this as a fun place to hang out. Two must-haves for many homeowners: a wet bar and a media area for your TV or video projector screen.<br><br></p> <h3> <strong>For many, these two items “Make” the mancave. But why not add extra areas?</strong> </h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/man-cave-layout-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <ul> <li> <p>Game area, with billiards or ping pong tables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Two or three rad, retro ’80s video game consoles, like Pac Man.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ballet barre running along a wall with floor-to-ceiling mirrors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Studio area for throwing pottery on a wheel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sunny spot next to a window for setting up a desk and writing that great novel.</p> </li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p><strong><br>Tips to Creating and Laying Out your Man Cave<br><br></strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Getting Ideas for you Man Cave Design First things first.
