Leaving the gym or your house sweaty is really unappealing.

So what is the best solution when your body feels tired and exhausted?</p> <p>A Nap; of course nothing beats a nap after a long exhausting workout, so your man cave might also need a bed right?</p> <p>Try investing in a foldable bed which can be hidden at the back of the lockers after use.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Foldable beds </strong>are also suitable for those man caves who have less space.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>A<span> </span><strong>Murphy bed </strong>will also be a good choice. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can also consider a<span> </span><strong>sofa bed</strong>, which can be transformed into a bed when you want to take a nap and be a sofa if not in use.<br><br><br> </li> </ul> <ul></ul> <h2 style="text-align: center;"></h2> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Final Touch</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/triathletes-house-gym-16.jpg" style="float: none; display: block; margin: 10px auto;"></p> <p><strong>Accessorizing and Personal Touches</strong></p> <p>To be able to call your man cave as your own, give it some of your little personal touch.</p> <p>Are you a varsity player?</p> <p>Or have you won a championship in some physical competition?</p> <p>Why not frame some of you jerseys and hang it on your wall?</p> <p>Display your medals and trophies, and some your photos and <strong>man cave decors.</strong> (If you were a varsity player display some of your <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/man-cave-where-basketball-is-the-game" title="Man Cave - Where Basketball is The Game "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>sports equipment</strong></span></a> such as basketball balls).</p> <p>Man Caves are a perfect place where you could display the things that you are proud of.
