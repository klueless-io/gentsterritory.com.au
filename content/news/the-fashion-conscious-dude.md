It’s not uncommon for man caves to contain plenty of darker colors – black, browns, grays, and blues – to make it truly a cozy, albeit masculine, space.<br><br>Making a deliberate decision on the materials used in your man cave can add an identifying element to you too. The materials used in the furniture will also make a great difference in choosing for your man cave.<br><br>Leather made furniture brings out a <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/the-classy-old-timer-s-retreat" title="The Classy Old Timer's Retreat "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>classy and elegant vibe</strong></span></a> and is stain and water resistant, but can also be too hot to deal with if your man cave is not air-conditioned.<br><br>Leather made furniture is the best option you could get for your man cave.

And the fact is, no man cave is complete without a flat screen TV. But even more important than the size is the setup.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-fashion-conscious-dude-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>You must decide if you want a swivel mount or a flat mount.</p> <p>Do you want a flat screen TV or a curved TV?</p> <p>Are you thinking of investing in a smart TV?</p> <p>Once you have made the major decisions, figure out the best way to blend your new baby into the decor that you already have.</p> <p>Keep the aesthetic manly but mature. Your flat screen should also go with the right sound system. Though televisions have gotten louder nowadays, often times we find that their sound has gotten weaker and less "bassy" sound. So what can you do to get the ultimate man cave sound? Of course, invest in the right equipment.</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-fashion-conscious-dude-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">A soundbar will provide you with even better sound quality, a sleek aesthetic, and convenience. Not only is the cost of a soundbar usually pretty reasonable, mostly it comes with a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.<br><br>This means you can play music or watch television audio without getting up from your couch! Do not let visible wiring from TV, Xbox, detract from the overall design. <br><br>Plan a placement so cables can become more discreet in corners or hidden behind furniture. Use cable covers or consider securing a power strip to the back of furniture to keep the strip out of view.</p> <p> </p> <p>If wires cannot be concealed, group them together with zip-ties, or hook-and-loop straps to contain them into one unit. Aside from the air conditioner or heaters, and some symmetrical displays, your <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/theater-seating" title="theater seating "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>man cave theater setting</strong></span></a> is already good to go.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Drink Happy Thoughts</strong></h2> <p>(Preparing a Mini bar for your Man Cave)</p> <p>Your Parents, or even your wife or girlfriend (Well.. if you have one) will be glad to know that you will have your own mini bar in your man cave. They wouldn’t worry much about you getting drunk on clubs and bars at the middle of the night.</p> <p>Having a mini bar inside your man cave will not only be convenient just for you, but also for the people with you at home or your friends.</p> <p>Start by investing to some man cave bar shelves.

They are a very important part of any man cave.</p> <p>These bar stools can get quite pricey, but are totally worth the investment if hanging out by the bar and enjoying drinks with your friends are high on your priority list.</p> <p>A built in wine cooler or a <a href="https://amzn.to/2NBknVi" target="_blank" title="Heller 70L Electric Mini Bar Fridge " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>small fridge</strong></span></a> is an easy upgrade to almost any cabinet within your mini bar.

A flat screen TV will be a cool additional to your mini bar too. This is a great focal point for any bar and will bring lot of enjoyment.</p> <p>If you don’t have anything on TV, simply switch over to a music channel or and an apple TV box for loads of content on demand.

(Of course where else could you do it?) Well, that or wear an adult diaper and you're way too young to go that route.<br><br>Why settle for an average bathroom connected to your awesome man cave<br><br>Instead, go for the glory. Go for the manliest of bathrooms and design one that is creative, attractive, and functional. <br><br>Go for a simple yet elegant looking design. (See sample picture above.) You can choose earth tone colors and a cream or beige colored paint for the wall and dark colored tiles for the flooring. (It could be matte, gloss, or mosaic).<br><br>Use dim lights for the shower part and toilet, and choose the brighter ones in the sink and mirror. Accessorize it with a vanity mirror with lights on the sides.(Ladies aren't the only ones looking at themselves. Yes, guys want to look good too.)<br><br>The monochrome theme oozes masculinity. If you enjoy listening to music while you are having a shower or just plain sitting in your throne and scrolling to your phone, you can install a waterproof wireless speaker.<br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-fashion-conscious-dude-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;">After all, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a few tunes while you're in the shower in the early morning. Certain factors may vary in every man cave. It is also important to customize the design of your man cave according to your personal point of view and needs. You don’t necessarily need to spend a lot of money to build a valuable man cave; just be practical and reasonable from the planning stage down to your finishing touches. After all, everyone deserves a space to take reprieve from the demands of the day, an environment to create as their own.
