<p>Before you set out to set up your new space, let’s get one thing straight here. There is a <strong>difference between a man cave and bachelor pad</strong>. Understanding the difference as well as their form and function will send you down the right path, not to mention allow you to keep your “man card”.<br><br></p> <h2><strong>Men Who Date Don’t Have Man Caves</strong></h2> <h3><strong>The Bachelor Pad</strong></h3> <p>This is pretty much the only context you will ever hear a guy talk about any sort of “pad”.

It is a piece of your home that is truly yours free from the feminine sensibilities that typically dominate the household. Is mean to be a retreat where the man of the house can have some alone time, to engage in hobbies or to “chill” with male friends.</p> <p><strong>Man caves are often equipped with: <br><br></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NBknVi" target="_blank" title="Heller 70L Electric Mini Bar Fridge " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Beer fridges</strong></span></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vending machines</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li>Kegerators</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Putting greens</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Huge big screen TV and entertainment centers</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Musical instruments<br><br> </li> <li>Pool tables</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Boxing rings</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Bar</li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/sports-themed-man-cave" title="Sports Themed Man Cave "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Sports memorabilia or other collectors items</strong></span></a></li> </ul> <p>Manland, mantuary or manspace are other lesser known names of this male dominated space often located in a basement, den or garage.</p> <p>Man spaces establish an identity for a man and usually have little to no female influence.</p> <h2><strong><br> Halt, Who Goes There?</strong></h2> <p>To make a crude contrast, the <strong>bachelor pad is for getting close to women</strong>, while the <strong>man cave is for getting away from them</strong>.</p> <p>I know this isn’t always the case, but it’s certainly one way to remember the difference. Tricky to remember the difference? Just stop and think about it… who goes there?<br><br></p> <h2><strong>Simple Design Tips to Your Ultimate Bachelor Pad</strong></h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/comparison-of-man-cave-and-bachelor-pad-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Guys- are you looking for some simple ways to spruce up your <strong>bachelor pad</strong><u><br><br></u>You finally have your own place and have the freedom to design it <strong>YOUR</strong> way, but don’t know where to start?<br><br>You know you’re ready to turn your pad into a home you can be proud of and show off to friends and family, but hiring an interior designer can be costly.

If you don’t have one, you can always improvise. Embrace a simple yet functional kitchen that’s easy to navigate and clutter-free. If you don’t have enough storage areas, you can consider recycling an old ladder as an overhead pot and pan holder.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/comparison-of-man-cave-and-bachelor-pad-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>You can also look into small portable butcher block islands for some additional counter space. These pieces usually come with some extra built-in storage underneath as well. When planning for your kitchen, make sure you don’t neglect your dining area. Plan ahead and purchase a great bistro table so that you can have a separate space to sit and eat. This can also make it easier for you to entertain your friends and some family members.<br><br>Don’t skimp out on matching sets of plates and cutlery. This goes for mugs and glassware too. Having a uniform set can make your kitchen aesthetically pleasing to you and your guests. They’ll look better than the random pieces you can get from discount stores.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>The Bathroom</strong></h2> <p>Most people associate a luxurious bathroom space with female necessity. The truth, however, is that men need the same pampering space as women. <br><br> They need a good space to shave, enjoy a good hot shower and prepare for the day.You can get a showerhead that allows water to flow like rain. If there’s enough space, you can add a shower bench.</p> <p>You can use this space to decompress after a long day at work or at the gym. Adding a large mirror, plush bath mat and some fluffy towels can also add up to the overall theme of your bathroom.<br><br></p> <h2><strong>The Add-ons</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/comparison-of-man-cave-and-bachelor-pad-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>You may have things that don’t fit your home’s current theme. Before you throw them away, you should consider re-purposing them. Take, for example, your working desk. Instead of hiding it in another room, you should try incorporating it into your living room. It might not look conventional at first but with the right accessories and set up, it can even add value to your main room.</p> <p>If you have lots of photos, you can hang them in frames instead of keeping them in albums or your drawer. <strong>Pick frames that can match the theme</strong> of your home and set them up in a way that will complement your wall.</p> <p>To spice things up, you can add <strong>classy light fixtures</strong> in your hallways and kitchen. You can also upgrade your bedding and use quality candles and hand soaps in your bathroom.</p> <p>Remember, it’s not always about the big stuff. There are little things and simple bachelor pad ideas that you can do to pull your living space together and make it the envy of all the other bachelors in your building.</p> <p> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
