It can be the attic, an unused bathroom, the shed out the back, the , or the basement.<br><br>Or anywhere else that's spare, has adequate elbow room, and is left currently unused or pretty much abandoned.

You may have to agree to something in exchange for your man cave been allowed into the house. If your man cave is using up the only relaxation space, no one's going to end up happy.<br><br>Try offering one of the following in exchange, if your partner or housemate is interested: Setting up another room as a sewing room, exercise room, sauna and spa, playroom, model collection space, or astronomy observatory.<br><br><br>Promising a certain number of hours each month on household repairs, odd jobs, or chores. Arranging regular dates or family time.<br><br><br> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <h2><strong>Insulate and Sound-Proof the Room</strong></h2> <p><u><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Soundproof-a-Wall-or-Ceiling"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a></u>Man caves often start in corners of the house without insulation. Make your man cave warmer and more <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Soundproof-a-Wall-or-Ceiling">sound-proof</a> by installing fiberglass or other insulation material between the wall studs.</p> <p>Unless your cave is in a stand-alone shed, or you're living alone, put a priority on sound proofing when choosing insulation material. You don't want your midnight sports or poker game to be interrupted by a tired spouse or neighbor.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></p> <h2>Paint or Wallpaper the Room</h2> If you've been relegated to the dingiest, smallest room in the house, bright colors will give a sense of more light coming in, and more space. On the other hand, dark colors are good for home theater setups, or a relaxed bar-like atmosphere. <p> </p> <p>If you couldn't care less and just think a wall is a wall, congratulations. Skipping this step is the first benefit of having a space where you get to make the decisions.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-5.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <h2></h2> <h2></h2> <h2>Add lighting or curtains if needed</h2> <p>Install recessed lighting or a light on a dimmer switch if you want to watch movies in your man cave.</p> <p>If your man cave has windows, put up blackout curtains so you can pull them closed and game at three in the afternoon without the outside world butting in.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p> <h2> <br>Things You Must Have in Your Man Cave <br><u></u> </h2> <p style="float: left;"><u><a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgentsterritory.com.au%2F&amp;h=ATMXPXscO1axmXivMKtCipRF_7nAav4WB8vp6MK4CHLznVfLQjG2L9omycUCndg-_X3jrLDyuReWf_OUb11AuM2h2guxsL7aFzHehvKU4wsn7_SrxWxORQ"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-6.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a></u>Man Cave must-haves are all about comfort, convenience and a custom feel. A flat-screen TV, an Xbox and an awesome sound system are three essentials for any man cave.<br>But there’s more to outfitting a guy’s go-to hangout than the latest electronics. Things like flooring, lighting and furniture also play into the design, which men are happily being a part of. You can have a variety of <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/seating" title="furniture "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>furniture</strong></span></a> and <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/bar-gameroom" title="game accessories "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>accessories</strong></span></a> for your man cave in online stores like <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/" style="color: #0000ff;">gentsterritory.com.au</a></span></p> <p style="float: left;">“Getting the man involved is starting to be a trend,” says Abbie Jacobson, owner of Abbie Jacobson Design &amp; Decoration in Chicago. “Instead of the woman decorating it the way she thinks he wants it, he’s now making the decisions himself.” When a man chooses everything from furnishings to flooring, “it really becomes his sanctuary.”</p> <p style="float: right;">But whether or not he picks out the sofa, all man-cave dwellers must figure out what they want the room’s purpose to be (to get some alone time or to watch sports with pals) and its vibe (sophisticated club or casual hangout).

An option that works for any room: carpet tiles, which can be customized by color, pattern and size, and are made of nylon and vinyl composite that can be washed. <br><br><br><br> <h2><strong>Have Adequate Seating</strong></h2> <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-8.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>For the guy that plans to host a crowd, <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/seating/products/brown-leather-pillowtop-3-seat-home-theater-recliner-with-cup-holders" title="BROWN LEATHER PILLOWTOP 3-SEAT HOME THEATER RECLINER WITH CUP HOLDERS "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>a sofa</strong></span></a>, chairs, benches and bar stools (if there’s a bar) are essential. And to encourage everyone to put up their feet, get a few poufs, which are large cushions for the floor – like an ottoman without legs; add a wooden tray and you’ve got an instant side table.<br><br>If you prefer a high-end look, install tufted leather <a href="https://amzn.to/2NsLQby" target="_blank" title="Artificial Leather Club Chair " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>club chairs</strong></span></a>, ottomans and a really comfortable leather sofa, Jacobson says. “ A room with a mid-century modern look, which is popular for man caves, would look good with iconic pieces such as Eames or Eileen Gray chairs, or something timeless from Design Within Reach.” More products here: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/" style="color: #0000ff;">gentsterritory.com.au<br><br></a></span><br> <h2>Focus on Lighting</h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-9.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> You can figure out your lighting needs by determining the room’s purpose.<br><br>“Is it to do work? If so, I recommend task lighting like a gooseneck lamp or one that can rotate around with good LED lighting,” Jacobson says. “Do you want to read in a chair? Then you need a floor lamp.”<br><br>If your plan is to escape from the world, put your lights on a dimmer switch. And so your buddies aren’t sitting in the dark, <strong>install a chandelier that’s got a funky, sculptural look.</strong><br><br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-10.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"> <h2><strong>Install An Upscale Mini Fridge</strong></h2> <p>Whether to hold beer or bubbly, a <a href="https://amzn.to/2NBknVi" target="_blank" title="Heller 70L Electric Mini Bar Fridge " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>small refrigerator</strong></span></a> is a man cave must-have. If you want something that doesn’t look fit for a dorm room, find a fridge in chrome, a highly polished stainless steel or a cool color like red or lime, Jacobson says.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p> </p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-11.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p> <h2><strong>Provide a Variety of Entertainment Options</strong></h2> <p>Besides TV, you’ll want to provide other activities to keep yourself and the boys amused. Having multiple interactive entertainment options, such as video games, TV and a <strong>pool table</strong>, will help keep guests off of social media during bonding time.<br><br>Go old school with classics such as poker, a ping pong table, a pool table (get a combo pool/ping pong table if space is tight) and a dart board.

It can be anything from a stylish lounge to an ode to your old college crash-pad and everything in between. If you’re going to build yourself a man cave, you want to do it right, but you also don’t want to break the bank in the process. The average cost of a man cave is somewhere in the $5,000 to $10,000 range, according to Money Crashers editor Andrew Schrage. But you can do it a lot cheaper by following a few simple steps. <br> <br>Decide on a theme for your man cave that is inspired by your personality and interests. For example, if you're a big football fan, you can dress it up in football paraphernalia. <br><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/wall-art" title="wall art "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>Accessorize the walls</strong></span></a> of your space affordably by buying some posters from online retailers you can also visit here: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/" style="color: #0000ff;">gentsterritory.com.au</a></span>. Posters can often be purchased for a few bucks. For other accessories, consider displaying some of your own items like sports trophies, your favorite team jerseys, and other memorabilia.<br><br><br></p> <p style="float: left;"><br><br></p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-14.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p> <h2>Paint the Walls</h2> Your man cave to transform the look quickly and affordably.

Check garage sales in your neighborhood and online via Freecycle, a website where people advertise items that they would like to give away for free. If you’re lucky, you might be able to get your furniture without spending a dime. <br>Consider long-term costs if you plan to use a refrigerator in your man cave. You want to select one that’s large enough to contain an evening’s worth of food and beverages. However, you might want to stay away from a full-sized fridge, as the extra cost to buy and run it can be excessive.<br>You can yield additional savings buying a used model on Craigslist or by visiting your local Sears Appliance Outlet store, which usually has heavily discounted prices on refurbished and "scratch-and-dent" appliances.<br><br></p> <br> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-16.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p> <h2>Put a Bar and Games in Your Man Cave</h2> On the cheap. Nextag offers some of the best prices, according to Schrage. “You should be able find a smaller bar for around $100,” he says. If you want a bigger bar for your money, you can build one yourself with a home bar kit from your local home improvement center. <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-17.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br>If you want to put gaming systems or a pool, foosball or ping-pong table in your man cave, shop around for used ones. These can often be found at secondhand stores, sports consignment shops, garage sales and classified ad websites.</p> <p> <br><br><br><br></p> <p> </p> <h2 style="text-align: center;">7 Things to Take Care of When Planning a Man Cave</h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-18.jpg" style="display: block; float: none; margin: 10px auto;">The man cave. All men know there’s a lot more to it than just a couch and a keg of beer. It is a sanctuary in which you can relax after a long and stressful day at work, or unwind after you finished your obligations. Even researchers confirmed that having a bit of solo leisure time can be very beneficial for men, as it significantly reduces cortisol levels. So, have you considered making your own happy den? If you have, then here are some tips on how to make that dream come true. Or check out <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Man-Cave" style="color: #0000ff;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Man Caves on a Budget</a></span> for other helpful tips<br><br></p> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <br> <h2>1. Choose the space</h2> <img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-19.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The term “man cave” is used relatively loosely when it comes to placement. It can be anywhere you like: from basement to attic, or even a shed in the backyard. The possibilities are endless. If you’re confined to a smaller space or an apartment, get creative: figure out how the layout can work to your advantage. <p> </p> Maybe there's an alcove that can be perfect for a bar, since you want to place those away from foot traffic. You can even turn a closet into your own unique space.<br><br><br><br><br> <h2>2. Design</h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-20.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> Measure the space you’re going to use for your man cave. Transfer these measurements (scale it down, of course) and plan your cave in detail. The more details you work out on paper, the less problems when it comes to actual building. <br> <br> If you’d like a themed man cave, pick an object you like, such as pool table, or a favorite picture, and use it as an inspiration in choosing the overall look. <br> <br><br><br> <br> <br> <br> <h2>3. Plan</h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-21.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> Make a list of all the materials and tools you’re going to need, determine the budget for the overall man cave building. Whatever tool you don’t have but will likely need, borrow it from a friend or buy it.<br><br>And don’t forget, when building a budget, leave al least about 10-15% on the side for any unanticipated costs. <br> <br> <br> <h2>4. Attic Man Cave</h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-22.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> If you have an unused attic, consider moving your <u>man cave</u> upstairs instead of occupying some other needed spaces. First determine if your attic is suitable for such an endeavor. The roof, usually “hugging” the whole room naturally has to be in great condition.<br><br>ASAP roof painting professionals recommend when making a man cave to take extra care of your roof, and look for signs of any leakage, moist, critters, and punctures. Also, by installing a roof window you’ll get a sense of bigger and brighter space in your man cave.<br><br><br> <br> <h2>5. Basement Man Cave</h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-23.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> The basement man cave is a little easier to make, although you need to <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/stry/basementremodels2">check for moist</a>, since a long exposure to it can be harmful for the lungs. Take care of the ventilation and if your build requires plumbing, electrical or HVAC work, you need to contact licensed professionals for their input or services. <br> <br> If you were considering hooking up a TV, consoles, or a home theater, make sure to build in-wall HDMI, have speaker cables and wall plates for functionality. <br> <br> <br><br><br> <br> <br> <h2>6. Furniture</h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-24.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> Get the comfiest couches, armchairs, recliners, or beanbags you can find and put in tables and other furniture. If you have room, you can put in a book case for your books, trophies and <a href="https://amzn.to/2O4lJVe" target="_blank" title="Mainstreet Classics Backgammon Board Game Set " rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>board games</strong></span></a>. <br> <br> Make sure to have a card table if you’re into card and board games and you can buy a few of those compact chairs. And lastly based on your preferences, add a TV or radio, console, a mini-fridge or a bar, the possibilities are endless.

Decoration</h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/customizing-a-man-s-cave-25.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <p>If <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/things-you-must-have-in-your-man-cave?utm_term=.rrbAkWD2MQ#.kiN2EGaZjq">decorating</a> isn’t your forte, you can hire an interior designer do to that for you. They can help you add a personal touch to your special<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> man cave</span>. <br> <br> It doesn’t even have to be sports oriented – if you’re a music fan, you can turn it into a recording studio; if you like to paint – create in your own art studio, etc. <br> <br> You can add flair to the walls by painting them a fun color, covering them in stone or wood or decorating them with artwork, posters or collectibles. <br> </p> <p> </p> <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2> Men often want a place where they can get away and relax, either by themselves or with friends. Just don’t go overboard. When you’ve created your perfect little den, don’t forget to get out of it from time to time! <div style="text-align: left;"></div>
