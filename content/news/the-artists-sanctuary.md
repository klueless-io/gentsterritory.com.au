<p>When we were young, we used to draw things and doodles when we are bored or to distract ourselves, sometimes we will draw on pretty much anything, from your dad's law books to the walls in your home, sometimes we draw anything we imagine for no reason at all.</p> <p> It is said that us humans needs something to let out our artistic side, and pretty much the first obvious way is that grabbing on to something that leaves a mark on surfaces and start drawing on them.</p> <p>There are some industries that needs the skills and talents of an adept visual artist (so don't believe that one guy who tells you that your drawing talent will lead you to nowhere in life).</p> <p>In fact, today the world needs a lot of skilled professional artists that solely rely on their drawing skills, such as:<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Animators</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-artists-sanctuary-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>They are the guys who designs and develops the characters, backgrounds, levels and pretty much anything that can be perceived visually for various applications in any motion graphics for TV and film, video games development, and others where animations is needed. ( so if you are into drawing and gaming, then the gaming world may need your skills to develop new games in the future!)<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Fashion Designers <br><br></strong></h3> <p>There’s lots of clothing like outerwear, underwear, street wear, and formal wear including shoes and accessories, and all of it needs to be designed, and if you are into designing clothes and apparel like Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani (the men themselves, not the brand), Fashion designers create wearables with performance, comfort, and style in mind.<br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Motion Graphic Designers </strong><br><br> </h3> <p>Motion graphic designers are the guys who adds visual effects in movies and TV shows, like exaggerating big explosions and sophisticated 3D models (like the aliens on later Aliens movies, and also exaggerating some gory scenes on horror films).</p> <p>Not to be confused with animators (who do fully digital images and puts them to motion), motion graphics designers create and edit imagery in a live action shot (they also add the "skin" on mocap actors digitally), which might also contain animation and special effects.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Industrial Designers</strong></h3> <p>These are the guys who designs pretty much all the products that we use, from cars to home appliances to manufactured goods.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-artists-sanctuary-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <ul></ul> <p>Industrial designers needs to consider a lot of factors like function, aesthetics, and production cost, which the propose their designs to their respective project managers, and will eventually appear on the products that we use every day (let's just say that these guys designed pretty much all the famous everyday products that we use).<br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Art Teachers</strong><br><br> </h3> <p>They are the guys that inspire and encourage young visual artists. You are the guy who awakens the inner creativity of your students by guiding them to the right path, imparting your knowledge to them along the way. You are the reason why there are a lot of awesome visual artists in any field of work!<br><br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h3><strong>Make-up Artists </strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-artists-sanctuary-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">If painter have a canvas for their mediums, and animators and graphics designers have sophisticated software to make their craft, you on the other hand, have the face and body of your clients as your canvas.<br><br>Your main expertise is in cosmetic, may it be simple make-up for daily use or elaborate and complicated ones used for a science fiction movie, you got it all covered! (you are the only artist who have a real living human being as your medium, so how cool is that?)<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Painters</strong></h3> <p>Do you want to be the next Vincent Van Goh or Pablo Picasso and have a fine taste when it comes to painting?</p> <ul></ul> <p>Well then this job will very suit you. You can totally express yourself unhindered without the judgmental gazes of other people or beating any deadlines. Who knows, maybe your next work will worth millions in the eyes of an art critic!</p> <p>Those are just the most common professions visual artists end up with.</p> <p>And of course, every visual artist have their own private den where they can totally concentrate on their craft, where they can completely work in peace without the distractions from the outside world, and where they can display their precious works, ready to be revealed to the world!<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>The Oasis of Creativity</strong></h2> <p>Of course, as an aspiring artist, you need to have your own workshop/man cave where you can practice your skills and <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/scale-modelers-man-cave" title="The Scale Modeler's Workshop "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>hone your craft</strong></span></a> right?</p> <p>So, here are the tips that can serve as your basis in creating your own man cave:</p> Just like how people judge the best liquor, the best room in the house suited for your workshop/man cave is, of course, your favorite room, may it be your own bedroom, the attic, the basement, your garage or that quite vacant guest room just beside your room.<br> <ul></ul> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-artists-sanctuary-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>It doesn't matter what room since we can still fix that further in the article and what is important is that this room will give you a peace of mind, a tranquil surrounding, and invokes your inner creativity out.</p> You need to check if the room that you have chosen have enough space for your things and for you to create your masterpieces. A wide space is ideal where fresh air can circulate and for your mind to wander around, gathering ideas as it walks by.<br> <ul></ul> <p>A messy and tight room will make you wish to stop and finish your work before it even started.</p> You wish to have bright colors for your walls and ceiling. Very light colors such as:<br> <ul></ul> <ul> <li> <p>Of course, White for purity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Light green to embody nature on your room.</p> </li> <li> <p>Muted yellow to cheer your spirits up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Different shades of orange to bring out that inner creativity in you.</p> </li> <li> <p>And light shades of blue to clear your thoughts and induce relaxation.</p> </li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p>Always <strong>avoid painting your walls totally with colors</strong> such as</p> <h3> <br>Neon yellow </h3> <p>for it actually irritates the eye and will make you feel more strained and pressed for time.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Black</strong></h3> <p>Black furniture or small accents give a great sense of power, but don’t overdo black because the end effect will be depressing and heavy, unless if you are a death metal fan.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Dark brown</strong></h3> <p>it's heaviness leaves the room looking gloomy and confined. What’s more, the dark shades may make you feel unmotivated to start up your work.</p> <ul></ul> <br>Also check if the place have working electrical outlets and lightings too. (no one wants to draw in the dark, unlike if you are a masochist who wants to feel perpetual suffering).
