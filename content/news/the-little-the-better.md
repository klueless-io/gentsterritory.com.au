Designing a room in the house, in general, can sometimes be a daunting task, but along with a proper guide and planning, the process becomes enjoyable.</p> <div style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-little-the-better-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></div> <p>To best understand what a man cave is and to maximize your man cave to its fullest potential, here is a list of important design considerations and features in planning a man cave:<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Man Cave Ideas for a Small Room</strong></h3> <p>Depending on where you live, and who you live with, space can be at a premium and that’s especially true in the UK where houses, apartments and flats are generally smaller than those across the pond in the US and Canada.</p> <p>Well, lucky for you, man cave ideas for a small room aren’t actually as limiting as you would think. So if you’ve been crammed into an old garden shed or a tiny spare room never fear because A Man’s Room is here!

Unlike those lucky men with entire <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/turning-your-garage-toa-car-lover-man-cave" title="CAR LOVER - GARAGE MAN CAVE "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>garages</strong></span></a>, basements or attics to play with, here you have to quickly decide what the most important aspects of your man cave will be.</p> <p>That might seem like a strange process but all you need to do is think; “What do I love the most?” No we’re not asking you to get all weepy and start reminiscing about ex-girlfriends. You can do that <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/men-go-pub" title="Men Go Pub "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>in private when you’re drinking heavily</strong></span></a>, like a real man.</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-little-the-better-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Asking yourself that question should actually kick start things. For example, if you love your football, you’ll most likely want a <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/sports-themed-man-cave" title="Sports Themed Man Cave "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>man cave perfectly setup</strong></span></a> for Super Sundays and Monday Night Football in the company of Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher.<br><br>If you’re a gamer then your new man cave will probably be a <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/portal-tothe-gaming-world" title="Portal To the Gaming World "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>gaming den</strong></span></a> focused completely on your console or PC setup and if you’re a musician you might want a <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/blogs/news/the-audiophiles-den" title="The Audiophile's Den "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>space to play and practice in peace</strong></span></a>.<br><br>There are so many variations and if you had more space then your man cave could be dedicated to multiple passions and hobbies but in this case, keep it simple at least to begin with.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Think Multi-Function</strong></h3> <p>After you’ve decided what you want to do with your smaller man cave the next step is installing furniture and storage that won’t instantly fill the room and suck all available space away.</p> <p>Again, keeping things simple is key and to do this we recommend thinking about using “multi-function” pieces. Essentially this means furniture that doubles up as storage space and vice versa.</p> <p>No matter what you want to use your man cave for it’s highly likely you’ll need a <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/recliners/products/black-leather-recliner-and-ottoman-with-maple-wood-base" title="BLACK LEATHER RECLINER AND OTTOMAN WITH MAPLE WOOD BASE "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>chair</strong></span></a> and a desk or cabinet. Even if you decide to mount your TV to the wall you’ll still need some of these items so always keep “multi-function” in mind like these folding <a href="https://amzn.to/2NtkvG8" target="_blank" title="Bar Stool" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>stools</strong></span></a> and <strong>chests</strong>.</p> <p>You will also love the practicality of something like 4-tiered fold-away shelf/desk combo. Also, if you need more chairs from time to time go for fold-up options that can be easily stored away or stacked somewhere out of sight.

Again, if you’re lacking in floor space think about using floating shelves and <strong>corner shelving</strong> to get the most out of your smaller man cave space.</p> <p>Also, if you’re not hobbit sized (we like Lord of the Rings, deal with it) then you could consider installing shelves slightly higher than you usually would for the rest of your house.<br><br></p> <h2><strong>Think Design</strong></h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-little-the-better-5.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Still with us? Keep going, it’ll be worth it when you have a brand-new man cave to call your own that doesn’t suck and look like a spare room or glorified storage space.<br><br>The key to getting the most out of your new man cave, even when it is in a small room, is to think about every detail. A room is the combination of multiple elements<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Mirrors</strong></h2> <p>You might not like the old mug that stares back at you every morning but mirrors can be your best friend when it comes to creating the impression of more space in a small man cave.</p> <p>Obviously you don’t want a huge mirror to dominate the room so consider your available wall space and choose something to compliment it. <br><br> Also, remember to hang or mount your <a href="https://gentsterritory.com.au/collections/mirrors/products/jack-daniels-pub-mirror-with-black-finish" title="JACK DANIEL'S PUB MIRROR WITH BLACK FINISH "><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>mirror to the wall</strong></span></a> to save on that precious, precious floor space.

When you’re working with a<strong> small man cave</strong> you need to focus on creating the impression of more space and dark colours do the absolute opposite.</p> <p>So, unless you purposely want to create a pit of despair (too dramatic?), choose bright colours that open the room out, shows all available space and doesn’t close off corners. <br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Think Items</strong></h2> <p>After you’ve carefully worked through the process of designing your new small room man cave it’s time to think about what the hell you’re going to put in there, stick on shelves and hang on walls.</p> <p>Luckily, we’ve got a few different posts for your pleasure and perusal so whether it’s man cave beers, <a href="https://amzn.to/2NtKHAn" target="_blank" title="Iconic Home Dafna Accent Club Chair" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>cushions</strong></span></a>, Fallout memorabilia or just the plain old man cave essentials; we’ve got you covered.

When older spaces are emptied, it can be utilized for a new purpose, no matter how small its area may be. <br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-little-the-better-8.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">It can be a former guest room or neglected spaces in the home like attics or garages. The trick to re-purposing is to study the existing site conditions of the space, then take into consideration its features in order to maximize it to its fullest potential.<br><br>Man Cave mixed with a separate space – A man cave does not always have to be enclosed, sometimes it can be mixed an already existing area of the house like an empty guest bedroom, a living room extension, a patio or garage. Another option is to combine a private office with a library.<br><br>The main advantage of man caves with combined spaces is that it allows you to cater to two needs simultaneously, or if more preferred it can be used as a man cave space as needed, but the primary purpose of the space is still met.<br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Tips on Designing a Small Man Cave</strong><br><br><strong>Consider Comfort</strong> </h3> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-little-the-better-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></strong></p> <p>A man cave is designed to help you unwind after a long tiring day or to simply enjoy some personal relaxation and recreation.</p> <p>With that mind, your primary goal in designing a man cave should always be comfort, regardless of the size of the space.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Keep it light and bright</strong></h3> <p>As a general rule in design, white and light colors can instantly make small rooms appear bigger because they bounce off light better than dark colors.</p> <p>A <strong>light color palette can add life to a space</strong> without being too heavy on the eyes, while a color scheme that is dominated by crisp white tones can make a man cave feel more airy and bright.
